###  Welcome to the repository for my exam projects! This collection showcases my skills in UI testing using Selenium WebDriver with the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern and Selenium IDE. Below you will find detailed descriptions, usage instructions, and examples for each of these projects. The projects demonstrate my proficiency in writing clean, maintainable, and efficient test automation scripts for web applications.

## Selenium POM
This project involves creating automated UI tests using the Selenium WebDriver and implementing the Page Object Model (POM) pattern. The POM design pattern helps in making tests more maintainable and reusable by separating the web elements and their actions into specific page classes. This project includes:
- Setting up Selenium WebDriver for Chrome.
- Writing automated tests using NUnit for testing various functionalities of the web application.
- Implementing POM to manage web elements and interactions on different pages.
- Using the `ChromeDriver` for cross-browser testing and compatibility.

### Key Features:
- Test cases covering login, registration, form submissions, and data validation.
- Structured POM-based test architecture.
- NUnit integration for assertions and test management.
- Automated test execution with clear reporting.

## Selenium IDE
This project demonstrates my skills in using Selenium IDE, a record-and-playback tool, to quickly create and execute UI tests without needing to write code manually. Selenium IDE allows for easy test case creation and provides a way to export these tests into different programming languages if further customization is required.

### Key Features:
- Creating automated tests through recording user interactions with the browser.
- Exporting test scripts in different formats, such as C# with WebDriver code.
- Running automated tests directly from the browser to quickly verify web functionalities.
- Integrating with GitHub Actions for continuous testing and reporting.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites:
- **C#** and **.NET Core** installed on your local machine.
- **NUnit** test framework and **ChromeDriver** for browser testing.
- **Selenium IDE** installed as a browser extension for quick test creation.
